Presence detection is done by combination of two components: [Asuswrt](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/asuswrt/) and [Life360](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/life360/). Asuswrt connects to my router and check if any of family members phone is connected to WiFi. Life360 uses GPS phone location and zones to detect where person currently is. I did not want to use `group.all_devices` for tracking all family member home status, so I added also a [person](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/person/) component, configured each family member there and grouped them using [group](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/group/) as `group.family`. In main lovelace view there is a [picture-entity](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-entity/) for each family member. Each state has own picture that is [Nintendo Switch Mii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mii).
